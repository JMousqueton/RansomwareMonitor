(263, '<b>LockData Auction</b>\n<b>About the victim:</b>\n<b>Crary Industries Inc.</b> Crary Industries exemplifies that spirit which is the heritage of people living in the northern plains. Reinhold Delzer saw a need for combine attachments that helped farmers harvest sunflower seeds. To manufacture these attachments and provide machining services for area Ag businesses he founded the Delzer Machine Shop. In 1979 the health of the company founder led to the sale of his company to Chuck and Joe Crary. Neither Chuck, a certified public accountant for a regional accounting firm, nor Joe, a real estate broker and developer, had any experience in manufacturing, but like the pioneers before them they took a chance. Shortly after selling the Company Reinhold Delzer died. Lacking experience the new owners turned to another valued northern plains trait: cooperation. They knew if they surrounded themselves with good people the company would prosper. In a manner similar to that of a traditional barn raising, they sought out people in the community to help. Mechanical engineering students at N.D. State University helped design and draft equipment. Moorhead State students were brought in to help market and advertise. Members of Service Corp Of Retired Executives (SCORE) provided purchasing and management insight. The lead person in setting up the manufacturing process was Bill Kohler, a retired tool and die maker. His dedication, long hours and ability to make use of limited resources were instrumental in getting the company going.<b>Amount of information: 48 GB</b> <b>Content:</b> Partner data, personal customer data, corporate mail archives, personal data of employees, financial papers, accounting reports, projects and plan.

To take action in life to teach their minds how to be more resilient, calm, and how to embrace life with their whole being----rather than fighting with life or themselves.” We want all people to know that they are not alone in their human experience.

This is a very serious miss for a large retail network of over 200 stores in six states. Not just sponsorship and philanthropy create a positive impact, but also decent information security, positioning yourself correctly in the marketplace, competitiveness and foresight that you do not possess.

But the data of Imperial Western Products, that is related to employees, finances, agreements is no longer confidential and this should make employees, partners and customers think twice about company\'s quality, value and service.

A company working with a platform like BUTTER must take care of its information security if it works with information, content and tracking all market movements, new SEC and patent filings, trademarks and financial and investment decisions itself.

(1385, '<b>Conti:</b>\nagencegoodwin \n\nhttps://en.agencegoodwin.com/ \n\nThe Goodwin Agency is, first and foremost, a team. At its head are three partners: Camille, Marie-Claude and Nathalie Goodwin. They represent more than 150 artists working on every continent of the globe in creative areas that vary from acting, staging, directing, scriptwriting, book writing, set, costume and lighting design, choreography and music composition.\nOver the last 30 years, the Goodwin Agency has become a benchmark for success in Quebec’s cultural milieu. To this day, it remains the only one to represent so many artists working in so many different disciplines. Furthermore, the team has a great depth of experience in the world and workings of productions, as well as a profound knowledge of client representation and negotiation in all areas of artistic activity.\nTaking its cue from the top US agencies, the Goodwin Agency also initiates projects in the fields of TV, film, theatre, literature, musicals and spectacles in order to share the brilliance of Quebec’s massive pool of talent with everybody both here and overseas.\nBEGINNINGS\nIn the 1960’s, John Goodwin was a management consultant whose skills, flexibility and expertise covered a lot of ground from administration to crisis management and executive headhunting, to name but three.\n\nIt was not until he first came to the help of companies working in the cultural sector, such as the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and, more particularly, in 1969, in the now legendary Théâtre de Quat’Sous, that John and his passion for the performing arts took a definitive step into his future.\n\nA promising young writer working with the theatre group caught his attention. John offered to become his agent. Over the coming years, he would guide this client – his very first – to the heights of a decorated and award-wining literary giant whose books and plays have been translated into 40 languages. Michel Tremblay remains, to this day, a client of the agency.\n\nDuring the next two decades, John founded Goodwin Management and this is where another key player stepped into the picture. His wife, Camille Goodwin, provided a crucial second wing as she skilfully covered a wide range of key, hands-on functions in the fast-growing literary and theatrical agency.\n\nThis was a time when many artists could not keep up with the business’ rapidly changing realities. Its new complexities made them vulnerable to signing contracts that were less than ideal. John and Camille took on the business of negotiating contracts that protected and furthered their clients’ interests thereby setting the tone for a fairer future for film, TV and theatrical artists. The business was growing.\n\nSadly, John Goodwin died in 1988 at a time when his twin daughters, Nathalie and Marie-Claude, were two years away from graduating from law school. The young women urged their mother to keep going for the next two years, and promised to come aboard and help as soon as they could.\nA NEW GENERATION\nWhen the Goodwin sisters graduated in 1990, their timing could not have been better. The fact that Nathalie and Marie-Claude’s parents had already put the company on a steady footing was only part of the picture.\n\nThe entertainment industry was booming and its contractual relationships and conditions had been growing increasingly complex for some decades. The consultative roles and importance of lawyers were evolving dramatically as they started moving from the wings to centre stage management.\n\nThe Goodwin Agency now had not one but two legal talents, both steeped in the family business since childhood. Together with their mother Camille, Nathalie and Marie-Claude Goodwin have ridden the waves of change, initiated a focus on foreign markets, widened their client base and steered the agency to the top of their field. They now set the pace for everyone else as they promote and manage the careers of Canadian talent operating, literally, all over the globe. \n\n<b>Address:</b>\nAGENCE GOODWIN\n839, East Sherbrooke Street, # 200\nMontreal (Québec)\nH2L 1K6\n\nTelephone: (514) 598-5252\nFax: (514) 598-1878\nEmail : artistes@agencegoodwin.com\n\nAGENTS-PARTNERS\nCamille Goodwin #232 cgoodwin@agencegoodwin.com\nMarie-Claude Goodwin #225 mcgoodwin@agencegoodwin.com\nNathalie Goodwin #223 ngoodwin@agencegoodwin.com\n\nHEAD OF LEGAL DEPARTMENT\nMarie Rodrigue #228 mrodrigue@agencegoodwin.com\n\nADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR\nMylène Azar #233 mazar@agencegoodwin.com\n\nAGENTS-COORDINATORS\nVirginie Bazin #237 vbazin@agencegoodwin.com\nLouise Jokisch #224 ljokisch@agencegoodwin.com\n\nASSISTANT COORDINATOR\nClaudine St-Ignan #221 cstignan@agencegoodwin.com\n\nCONTRACT MANAGER\nMichelle Roberge #229 mroberge@agencegoodwin.com \n\nCONTRACT TECHNICIAN\nKarine Paradis #235 kparadis@agencegoodwin.com \n\nADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT\nCamille Gaudreault #238 cgaudreault@agencegoodwin.com\n\nLITERARY AGENT\nPatrick Leimgruber #226 pleimgruber@agencegoodwin.com \n\n<b>Publish Date:</b>\n12/10/2021\n\n<b>Published 0% of data.\n Seen 16816 times.</b>'),

Today, Parco has four modern facilities manufacturing O-rings, custom-molded elastomeric seals, rubber-to-metal bonded parts, and machined metal parts. Our 154,000 square-foot facility in Ontario, California is one of the largest plants in the world making molded rubber seals. Our three other facilities in Texas and Louisiana specialize in complex custom-molded elastomeric products, machined metal parts, and machined plastics.\n\nWeve implemented quality and management systems that measure up to the toughest standards. In R & D, tooling, and production, we have developed techniques and software that make Parco products the best in the business. We test every batch of material to verify that its key physical properties are conforming. Every molding press is computer controlled to ensure consistency and to optimize productivity. And we know neatness counts. All of our plants are clean and orderly, and our equipment is well maintained.\n\nTo maintain the highest quality we make our own molds, develop and mix our own compounds, and mold our parts in computer-controlled presses. We use video inspection machines to check each part for surface defects and dimensional accuracy. Our quality management system is certified to international standards ISO 9001 and ISO/TS 16949 and aerospace standards AS9100 and AC7115.\n\nOur mission is simple: to improve our products and services continually to meet or exceed our customers sealing needs.\n\nIn 2018, Parco was acquired by the Datwyler Group, a focused industrial supplier with leading positions in global and regional market segments. Parco is now part of Datwylers Sealing Solutions Division, a leading supplier of customized sealing solutions to demanding industries including automotive, healthcare, and consumer goods.

(1581, '<b>Conti:</b>\nCAVENDERS \n\nwww.cavenders.com \n\nCavender\'s was founded in 1965, in the small east Texas town of Pittsburg. James and Pat Cavender were entrepreneurs who dabbled in several ventures before opening a clothing business. James had a sharp wit, boundless energy, and he found the perfect combination for his skills, personality and experiences serving customers a quality product at a fair price. As a country boy in a small Texas town, it was only natural to carry cowboy boots. Cavender\'s started with 3 styles of Tony Lama boots. They sold well, and so James bought more. It was just the beginning for this family company that would go on to sell millions of pairs of boots and become the fastest growing Western wear chain in America.\n\nWhether it was buying (and reselling, of course) a cattle trailer load of boots from a manufacturer going out of business in the 1970s, riding the high of the Urban Cowboy craze in the 1980s, surviving—and in fact thriving—in its decline, or partnering with another up-and-coming Texas icon, George Strait, Cavender\'s has always had a knack for being in the right place at the right time. But more than that, Cavender\'s has thrived based on its half-century plus commitment to the customer by providing the best products at affordable prices with excellent customer service. \n\n<b>Address:</b>\n(888) 361-2555\nbyron@cavenders.com, annalisa@cavenders.com, bo@cavenders.com, clay@cavenders.com, jrandall@cavenders.com, josh@cavenders.com, dempsey@cavenders.com\nEsmondd@cavenders.com, charles@cavenders.com, susan@cavenders.com, mike@cavenders.com, Troy@cavenders.com, shampton@cavenders.com,larry@cavenders.com\njoe@cavenders.com, tmeyer@cavenders.com, elaine@cavenders.com, jim@cavenders.com, kerry@cavenders.com \n\n<b>Publish Date:</b>\n30/04/2021\n\n<b>Published 100% of data.\n Seen 133568 times.</b>'),

We deliver to every county throughout Tennessee with customers in the bar, restaurant, grocery and retail businesses. Athens Distributing has been in business for over 75 years.<br>In 1946 John â€œChinkâ€ Donnelly and T. Howard White founded Athens Distributing Company of Tennessee. Already in the alcohol distribution business as a sales rep, Chink was approached by Hiram Walker to start his own wholesale house. He teamed up with his brother-in-law Howard who would use his experience as Vice President of Third National Bank to run the inside operations of the business. The two men took a train to Detroit, Michigan, the home office of Hiram Walker Distillery and the deal was made on October 1st of 1946. With that one supplier, the first office and warehouse opened in Downtown Nashville with 15 employees and 2,000 square feet.<br>In 1961 Athens Distributing expanded its operations 133 miles East to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Chink and Howard bought the smallest wholesale house in the area and today it services the entire East Tennessee market.<br>In 1967 Athens Distributing continued growing its business footprint in Memphis, Tennessee 212 miles West of Nashville. By 1970 the founderâ€™s bought out fellow distributer Shelby Liquors. After this acquisition Athens Distributing Company of Memphis was now cemented as the largest wine and spirits wholesaler in West Tennessee â€“ and still is today.<br>What was now a business partnership had started many years earlier when Chink and Howard married sisters Reedy and Eloise. Family has always been at the heart of Athens Distributing Company. In its 4th generation of family ownership the current owners are direct descendants of the Donnelly and White families. What started as a new business with one brand, Imperial Whiskey, has flourished to a state wide company that values our relationship with the suppliers, customers and the 350+ employees that we call family.</p><p><strong>Address:</strong><br>Athens Distributing<br>3001 Owen Dr,<br>Antioch, TN 37013</p><p><strong>Publish Date:</strong><br>05/02/2022</p><p>Published 10% of data.<br>Seen 57 times.<br><strong>Detection time</strong>:07/02/2022 02:22:07</p>'),

(11238, '<b>Conti:</b>\nSchultze and Braun \n\nhttps://www.schultze-braun.de \n\nSchultze &amp; Braun is one of Germany’s leading law firms providing advice to distressed companies, and those who do business with such companies, on all aspects of sustainable insolvency administration. Schultze &amp; Braun is one of the most frequently appointed insolvency administrators in Germany.\nWe advise clients on all aspects of restructuring, reorganisation and insolvency. Regionally, nationally and internationally. We develop perspectives for all parties – for entrepreneurs and employees, as well as for creditors and contractual partners. We also show clients how insolvency can be avoided. Naturally, we also provide business, legal and tax advice, as well as auditing services.\nSchultze &amp; Braun takes responsibility. For the companies and assets entrusted to it, and for the people involved. Our actions are guided by a sense of responsibility and a consistent commitment to finding the best solution for all parties. These values define not just the quality of our work, but also the identity that clients who work with us come to know and appreciate. \nThe success of Schultze &amp; Braun can also be attributed to one other aspect of the very specific way we work: our interdisciplinary approach. In 1975, Dr Eberhard Braun founded Germany’s first interdisciplinary firm of lawyers and tax advisers with a 20-strong team. By 2020, Schultze &amp; Braun had over 600 highly qualified and specialised employees at 40 locations across Europe. This approach works as well today as it did in the past: Teams of lawyers, auditors, tax advisers, business law specialists and businesspeople work hand in hand to provide clients with comprehensive advice on the full range of issues facing them and to offer them the best possible solution for their needs. Whatever phase they find themselves in. From our decades of experience in crisis management and insolvency administration, we know the opportunities that can emerge even in situations that appear hopeless. Our mission is to identify these opportunities, develop plans accordingly and work with our clients to implement them successfully. \n\n<b>Address:</b>\n25 Southampton Buildings, \nGB, London, \nGreater London, \nWC2A 1AL, \nUnited Kingdom \n\n<b>Publish Date:</b>\n23/02/2022\n\n<b>Published 2% of data.\n Seen 163 times.</b>\n<b>Detection time:</b>24/02/2022 09:50:31'),
